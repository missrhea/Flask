# Flask

1. Made a simple hello world flask application. --> https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/flask-creating-first-simple-application/

2. Made a HTML form. Wrote a python script with flask to add the submit form functionality --> https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/flask-creating-first-simple-application/

3. Created a very simple Linear Regression Model, using this dataset from Kaggle --> 
https://www.kaggle.com/andonians/random-linear-regression
Used the form functionality from the previous step to take an input and predict the output using the trained Linear Regression Model.

4. Built a gender predictor web app. The model was trained on a dataset of (name, sex) tuples.
